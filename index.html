    <h3>About Me</h3>


        <p><img src="images/port.jpeg" alt="portrait" class="responsive" />My real name is Eun Gyong Choi. In Korean, it is written as "최은경." My family immigrated to the U.S. in 1988 and they decided to use the English equivalent of my Korean name. However, they struggled to translate the Korean phonetic "경."  Therefore, my parents decided to be clever and assign me a name that would cause many non-Koreans to sweat a bit before attempting to say my name. Much to my dismay, I found out in second grade that "Gyong" could have been spelled as "Kyung" instead which would have reduced the number of takes it took for people to say my name correctly.</p>
        
        <p>Fast forward to 2019, I am now known as Chloe Choi. I started to go by that name since 2004 as soon as I stepped into my dorm room as a first year student at Rutgers University. Post graduation, I worked for about a year as a marketing coordinator before moving to Korea where I worked as a teacher in afterschool elementary academies. 
        Then in 2015, I moved back to the U.S. as a stay-at-home mom. However, life happened and now, I am a single mother trying to hack through this coding bootcamp.</p>
